### **Architecture & Design Traps**
- **Over-engineering early** - Building every extension hook before validating core functionality
- **Tight coupling** - Components depending on each other's internals instead of interfaces
- **Hook explosion** - Too many hooks making the system unpredictable and hard to debug
- **Extension conflicts** - Multiple extensions modifying the same data/behavior without mediation
- **Circular dependencies** - MagA needs MagB which needs MagC which needs MagA

### **Performance Killers**
- **Hook overhead** - Every operation triggering dozens of extension checks
- **N+1 queries** - Extension system causing database query multiplication
- **Memory leaks** - Extensions not cleaning up resources properly
- **Cache invalidation chaos** - Extensions breaking caching strategies
- **Real-time bottlenecks** - WebSocket connections overwhelming MagWS

### **Security Nightmares**
- **Sandbox escapes** - Extensions breaking out of isolation
- **Privilege escalation** - Extensions gaining unauthorized access
- **Data leakage** - Tenant data bleeding across boundaries
- **Supply chain attacks** - Malicious extensions in the marketplace
- **AI model poisoning** - Bad actors training MagSentinel to ignore threats

### **Developer Experience Issues**
- **Poor documentation** - Extensions failing because APIs aren't clear
- **Breaking changes** - Updates destroying existing extensions
- **Debug hell** - Can't trace which extension caused an issue
- **Version conflicts** - Extension A needs MagCore 2.0, Extension B needs 1.5

### **Operational Hazards**
- **Migration failures** - Database schema changes breaking in production
- **Rollback impossibility** - Can't undo a bad deployment
- **Monitoring blind spots** - Not seeing what's actually happening
- **Cost explosion** - AI models and infrastructure scaling out of control
- **Data loss** - Backup/restore not tested properly

### **Business/Market Risks**
- **Feature creep** - Building everything instead of MVP first
- **Ignoring feedback** - Building what you think users want vs. what they need
- **Pricing mistakes** - Too cheap (unsustainable) or too expensive (no adoption)
- **Lock-in backlash** - Making it too hard to migrate away (users avoid)

### **The Biggest One: Scope Paralysis**
With 73+ components, the temptation is to build them all. **Don't.** Pick the 5-10 that make the MVP viable, nail those, then expand.
