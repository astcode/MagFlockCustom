# MagMoBoCE Execution Checklist

Use this checklist to track enterprise-readiness tasks for the MagMoBo kernel and its first-wave integrations. Update status as items complete; keep aligned with `MagMoBo_KernelSpec.md`, `MagFlock_TechnicalBible.md`, and the Production Readiness Assessment.

---

## 1. Kernel Hardening & Test Coverage
- [ ] Expand PHPUnit coverage
  - [x] LifecycleManager success/failure paths
  - [x] EventBus sync/async emission (ordering, error handling)
  - [x] HealthMonitor escalation/recovery behaviour
  - [x] ConfigManager/StateManager/CacheManager validation and persistence cases
- [x] Add instrumentation hooks (structured log context, metrics counters per subsystem)
- [x] Provide safe kernel reset/unboot API for harness/CLI workflows
- [x] Define canonical event payload schemas for `system.*` and `component.*` channels
- [x] Document updated contract expectations in `MagMoBo_KernelSpec.md`

## 2. MagDS Integration (Storage Plane)
- [x] Implement MagDS component (connection pooling, migrations runner, health probes)
- [x] Wire MagDS config overrides per environment (`config/components.php`)
- [x] Extend test harness for live Postgres integration (docker 5433)
- [x] Add PHPUnit/integration tests covering connection bootstrap and telemetry (see `MagDBTest`)
- [x] Emit MagDS health telemetry onto EventBus

## 3. MagWS Integration (Realtime Plane)
- [ ] Implement MagWS component adapter (boot/start/stop hooks, channel registration)
- [ ] Integrate with Soketi/WebSocket service; ensure secure configuration path
- [ ] Enhance harness with mock websocket clients to validate publish/subscribe flow
- [ ] Add tests for subscription lifecycle, heartbeat handling, and failure recovery
- [ ] Surface realtime metrics (connection counts, message rates)

## 4. Extension Mediation Plane Foundations
- [ ] Scaffold Extension Kernel (registry, capability gatekeeper, lifecycle manager)
- [ ] Define component adapters (MagDS/MagWS/MagGate) exposing sanctioned hooks
- [ ] Seed capability catalog & enforcement rules (least privilege baseline)
- [ ] Align events with extension mediation requirements (`MagFlockExtensionSystem-TechSpec.md`)
- [ ] Update architecture docs to reflect four-plane model

## 5. Configuration & Secrets Overhaul
- [x] Introduce layered configs (base, environment, secrets) with schema validation
- [x] Implement hot reload notifications & rollback on validation failure
- [x] Integrate secret redaction and placeholder for MagVault future storage
- [x] Document configuration workflow for operators/developers
- [x] Add tests covering invalid config detection and reload behaviour

## 6. Observability & Operations
- [ ] Emit structured lifecycle/health events for MagMonitor ingestion
- [ ] Add minimal metrics exporter (boot time, bus throughput, restart counts)
- [ ] Ensure audit logging alignment with control-plane schema requirements
- [ ] Provide CLI commands (`kernel:status`, `component:list`, `component:restart`, `diagnostics:dump`)
- [ ] Capture ops runbooks (boot failure remediation, component restart procedures)

## 7. Continuous Verification
- [ ] Keep `composer kernel-smoke` updated with new component permutations
- [ ] Integrate PHPUnit suite into CI pipeline once available
- [ ] Track checklist progress within repo (update this file with `[x]`)
- [ ] Review `ArchitectureDesignTraps.md` after each major deliverable to avoid regression
- [ ] Sync Production Readiness Assessment milestones with actual completion dates

**Process Tip:** For every item, follow the loop: design notes → implementation → automated tests → docs update → mark checkbox. This keeps MagMoBoCE enterprise-ready as features land.
