# Why Mag as the prefix

## So "Mag" is short for "Magpie" - which perfectly aligns with the project's purpose. Magpies are known for:



- 1. **Collecting shiny things** - Much like how this system collects, organizes, and manages various data assets
- 2. **Storing and protecting treasures** - Which reflects how the database system securely stores and manages valuable data
- 3. **Being intelligent and adaptable** - Similar to how this PostgreSQL setup is designed to be flexible with numerous extensions
- 4. **Building secure nests** - Just like how the system provides secure, isolated environments for different projects and users

  
  ## This naming metaphor works exceptionally well for a data management platform:
- The PostgreSQL database with its many extensions is like a magpie's collection of shiny objects
- The role-based access control and project isolation mirror how magpies carefully organize and protect their collections
- The multi-tenant architecture (Community and Pro editions) reflects how magpies create separate, secure spaces for different purposes

  ## The name "Magpie" (and the "Mag" abbreviation) seems to capture the essence of what this platform does
  - intelligently collecting, organizing, securing, and providing access to valuable data assets, just like a magpie with its treasures.
